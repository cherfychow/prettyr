### A collection of RStudio themes created out of procrastination

Custom RStudio themes with full IDE styling inspired by Sublime Text, and adapted from [this One Dark Pro](https://github.com/johnnybarrels/rstudio-one-dark-pro-theme) and [Mojave](https://github.com/patrickshox/Mojave-Dark-RStudio-Theme) themes. Some colour palettes are from [base16 by Chris Kempson](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16).  

## Installation
```r
rstudioapi::addTheme('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cherfychow/prettyr/main/THEMENAMEHERE.rstheme')
```
If you'd like to use it right away, you can also add the `apply = TRUE` argument.
Themes look best if function highlighting and rainbow parentheses are enabled in Global Options > Code > Display
